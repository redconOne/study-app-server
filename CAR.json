    "answer": "When freelancing its not uncommon to work on numberous client projects simultaneously.

    "question": "Describe a situation in which you worked diligently on a project and it did not produce the desired results. Why didn't you get the desired results? What did you learn from the experience?",
    "answer": "When I first started building webpages I had an unsatisfied client, yet I had built exactly what they had asked for. I scheduled a meeting with them to go over the contract, compare that to the finished product, and recontract some work to get things to the result that they wanted. Because of this I often do mock-ups to ensure the client is completely clear with what they will be receiving as a final product, and haven't encountered any issues since."

I had to contact the client to notify them that we needed to make a quick change.

    "question": "Tell me about your experience at 100Devs",
    "answer": "My experience at 100Devs was pretty amazing overall.
