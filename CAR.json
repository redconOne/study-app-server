    "question": "Give me an example of the project or initiative that you started on your own. It can be a non-business one. What prompted you to get started?",
    "answer": "On one of my earlier group projects concerning APIs we were having difficulty accessing the specific API in the way that we wanted. Many in the group were wanting to move on to a different API that wouldn't have provided the same information, but I ended up taking the intiative to contact the team workin on the API and was able to get guidance. Funnily enough, not only did I get our project working, but the API documentation was changed to cover cases like ours, so they ended up better off for it as well."

    "answer": "A short while ago I was given task to complete, and I provided the requested product I was informed that I hadn't done what was required. I had to start over, asking what information was provided, what I was to do with that data, and then what data I needed to return. Now, to ensure complete understanding, even if I think I know exactly what is being asked of me I always clarify the task at hand."

I scheduled a meeting with them to go over the contract, compare that to the finished product, and recontract some work to get things to the result that they wanted. Because of this I often do mock-ups to ensure the client is completely clear with what they will be receiving as a final product, and haven't encountered any issues since."

    "question": "What is some critical feedback you've gotten recently?",
    "answer": "I have gotten some rough feedback about design choices recently. Working directly with clients and oftentimes without a designer leaves a good bit of the aesthetic of things open to interpretation.
